# mmip-map-server

This is the backend server for our Map of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Cases (MMIP). 
We built it ourselves using Node.js and Express 5 to provide simple, reliable API endpoints for our mapping platform.

## Project Description

mmip-map-server lets our web access and update MMIP case data. 
Explore the map to learn more about the locations and details of missing and murdered Indigenous people cases. 
Our goal is to help make this crisis more visible and accessible, so communities and advocates can better understand and take action.
